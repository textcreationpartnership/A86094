            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wee have little farther to ſay, then
<pb facs="tcp:166757:3"/> what is contained in the Booke, only deſire that the ſame may be read over with judgment: We have purpoſely left out our names, that the Reader may not wrong himſelf either through prejudice or partiality, but look ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the matter as it lies before him.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible ſome may thinke there was no neede that ſo much ſhould have been written as in reference to a particular perſon, but leſſe a great deale would have ſerv'd the turn.</p>
            <p>To which we anſwer, 1. It is well known, that many honeſt minded people, in regard of the ſeverall Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, which M. <hi>Lilburn</hi> hath ſpread abroad, have been very much abuſed and miſlead by him, inſomuch that without a large and clear diſcovery of his particular Crafts and deceits, we
<pb facs="tcp:166757:3"/> doubted whether ſuch perſons would have real and full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe we find Mr. <hi>Lilb.</hi> boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oftentimes of his <hi>quick &amp; ſharp pen</hi> wee have thought good to make one work of it; that is, to prevent his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Anſwer and Replies, in doing ſo much at once, as not to be troubled any more with him, but to ſtopp his mouth, and put him quite to ſilence.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The man hath been ſo long a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of the peace of the Common-wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th, and acted ſuch a multitude of ſeditious deſigns, as we could not in a little give the Nation a juſt account thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As our deſire is, that thoſe who are in Authority may go ſpeedily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the work of Reformation, ſo we conceive there being here full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:166757:4"/> given to the people of this Common-wealth, a ſtumbling-block will be removed, which he by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety and craft had caſt in their way.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken too much in the juſtification of bad men: For anſwer: Here we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to God, how farre we have been from pleading either for perſons or things otherwiſe then what conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, reaſon and juſtice hath guided us thereunto. It is chiefly the peace and ſafety of the Nation that wee have ſought after: And for this Nationall peace wee are willing to ſpend, and to be ſpent, and ſhall think our ſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently rewarded, if by the publiſhing of this Treatiſe wee may undeceive ſuch people, whom by his wiles and falſhoods hee hath formerly deceiv'd,
<pb facs="tcp:166757:4"/> and that hee may no more draw par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and factions after him.</p>
            <p>For concluſion; As in the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Book, we deſire a generall good, ſo in particular Mr. <hi>Lilburn.</hi> That he may ſee the error and evill of his ways. No doubt it would be much for the peace and comfort of his ſoule another day: If this counſell of ours were followed, namely as hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion of publick ſcandal to the world, by his ſeditious and mutinous carriages, ſo to make publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment thereof.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, it ſhall be our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: As perſons looking into a glaſſe, doe thereby amend what they ſee to be amiſſe, ſo this may ſerve as Mr. <hi>Lilburns</hi> LOOKING-GLASSE, wherein he may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Now for as much as it plainly appeared unto the Committee, that the Collierie was ſequeſtred by Sir <hi>William Armine</hi> in the yeare 1644. and had been. ſolely in the poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Wray,</hi> and his Agents three years before, and that it was let by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Sequeſtrations,</hi> in the yeare 1645. and no man had claimed any right or intereſt in it, untill Mr. <hi>George Lilburn</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Gray,</hi> two of the Committee poſſeſſed themſelves of it: And that there had been no order made either by the Lords and Commons for <hi>Sequestrations,</hi> nor the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee there; nor that there had been any authority for the diſpoſſeſſing the ſtate of their Intereſt, and that Mr. <hi>Wray</hi> a Recuſant and Dilinquent, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of compoſition: the Committee ordered <hi>Auguſt</hi> 13. 1649. <hi>That the ſequeſtration ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166757:16"/> upon the ſaid Collierie, for the uſe of the State, and that all thoſe who have had any uſe or profit of the ſaid Collierie, ſince the ſame was ſequeſtred; ſhould forthwith make</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Upon the making of this Order, Mr. <hi>George Lil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burn</hi> ſitting at the Committee (and being one of the Committee) immediately deſired a moneths time to make his title good; the which being granted, he went thereupon to <hi>London,</hi> and by the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, brought with him one Mr. <hi>Levit,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joſiah Primate,</hi> who being required by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to make good their Title (they and their Councel being put upon it to ſhew what title they had to the ſaid Collierie) affirmed by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that Mr. <hi>Wray</hi> had gotten their Evidences, and would have had the Committee to have compelled him to have produced his title. But the Committee replied, the matter was of very great concernment to the Common-wealth (the Collierie being worth 3000 <hi>l. per annum</hi>) and that Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> had made of it, after he had put the State out of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at leaſt 15 <hi>l. per diem,</hi> for a year together, as they were informed by thoſe that knew it well: And therefore durſt not be ſo falſe to their truſt, as when the State had been in poſſeſſion above three yeares, to produce Evidences to diveſt the State: Beſides, what they deſired was ſuch a thing as was never heard or granted in any Court, that a Plaintiff which ſued for a poſſeſſion of land, ſhould deſire the Defendant to make him a Title to out himſelfe. Therefore if Mr. <hi>Wray</hi> had gotten their Evidences into his hands, their way was plaine, to exhibite <hi>a Bill in Chancery,</hi> and there they might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166757:17"/> compell him to produce his Evidences in a legall way.</p>
            <p>For concluſion, whereas it did not appear to the Committee, that either Mr. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Levit,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Joſiah Primate</hi> would, or then could produce any Evidence in the leaſt, to overthrow or weaken Mr. <hi>Wrayes</hi> Title (he being then preſent, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Evidence in his hand, ready to make it good) but that the right of the whole Collierie was clearly in him: They confirmed their former Order (as in point of law &amp; conſcience they could do no leſſe) and afterward let the Collierie for the benefit and uſe of the Common-wealth; and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> might be called to accompt for the profits of the ſaid <hi>Collierie,</hi> they being aſſured that great ſumms <note n="ſ" place="margin">Were not theſe faithfull men to the State all the while, and fit to be of the Committe for <hi>Sequeſtration,</hi> that they would take into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion a thing which they knew was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and that the Common-wealth had an intereſt in it; honeſt men being as they were, emploi'd by the State, would have been aſhamed to have med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that <hi>Collierie.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Howſoever the Statutes which he repeated, ſay, <hi>That no man ſhall be condemned for Treaſon, petty Treaſon, or any ſuch like crime, but by the evident and clear proofe of two lawfull and ſufficient Witneſſes.</hi> Yet the ſame Statutes do likewiſe ſay, <hi>If the offender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confeſſe the Fact,</hi> it is as much <hi>as two,</hi> yea as tenn Witneſſes: And this was Mr. <hi>Lilb.

               <hi>it ſelf a proofe.</hi> His name and hand was at the Treaſon, ſo that it lay now upon him to make his defence to it. A mans owne hand to a Writing, yea if it be his name at a printed booke, as the Author, it makes the thing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood (whether good or bad) properly &amp; truly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:166757:48"/> his. For to this end are hands and names ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as to ſpeak out, a mans propriety, and what he owns: Neither is it neceſſary as to the certainty and truth of the thing, that there be any other proof or witneſſe.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that a mans hand may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, and his name ſet to a Book, as the Author, whereas its neither ſo, nor ſo.</p>
            <p>We anſwer; here Reaſon, Juſtice, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath provided a good Remedie, <hi>viz. by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it is not his,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ought in ſuch a caſe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nothing appearing or proved to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But for a man to ſet his name, and hand to a thing, and being afterward queſtioned for it, then to <hi>call for Witneſſes to prove that the name or hand is his,</hi> it is moſt ridiculous, the thing it ſelfe being proofe and <note n="e" place="margin">We grant that by law a man is not to accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: that is, where no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appears, there he is not bound to be witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But a mans name to a Book as the Author, is certainly a Witneſſe: (And note it) we ſay a witneſſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe: ſo that a man is bound in this caſe to anſwer as to a witneſſe, or rather witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

            <p>We obſerved before, how Mr. <hi>Lilburn without the least ſcruple of conſcience, could have deſtroyed ſome men as ſo many Weaſels and Poulcats.</hi> In this our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hangs not ſo looſe as his; For wee deſire to walk according to the rules of Reaſon and Juſtice.

            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:166757:49"/> his Tryall.

            <p>Now in this Book which he owned, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelfe the Author, the whole Treaſon whereof he was accuſed, and laid to his charge, is there <hi>maliciouſly or adviſedly publiſhed, by writing and printing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For 1. there he expreſly ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">There is a great myſtery in M. <hi>Lilburns</hi> words; we may not call it a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe poſſibly like the <hi>

            <p>But one thing here, is remarkable, to wit, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently his own groſſe hypocriſie is diſcovered by himſelf.

            <p n="1">1. We are altogether unſatisfied, as to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his coming over. He had before declared to the world; That <hi>England was too little for him and Cromwel:</hi> And <hi>was totally and poſitively reſolv'd (if he could chooſe) never to ſee</hi> England, <hi>ſo long as</hi> Cromwels <hi>moſt hatefull, deteſtable, and bloody tyranny laſted, unleſs it were in a way to purſue him as the</hi>

Now the things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he charged him with, were moſt horrible, but all untrue; yet he thought it would take the more with the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, becauſe he did accuſe him of ſuch foul and groſs things.</note> 
               <hi>grandeſt Tyrant &amp; Traytor that ever</hi> Engl. <hi>bred: and had rather live in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary widowhood all his days, then to live under</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels <hi>bloody Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when he was here, <hi>he was ſcarce able to reſiſt the dangerous and hazardous temptations concerning the killing of him:</hi> Yea, <hi>and had reſolved at the Parliament doore to have murdered him,</hi> but for the Reaſons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned: Theſe are his own words.</p>
            <p>Now taking it for granted (as wee ſuppoſe hee would have it ſo to be taken) that LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN LILBURN is not <hi>aliud ſtants, aliud ſedens,</hi> one while for the thing, another while againſt it; but as he ſaith himſelf <note n="b" place="margin">

For ſuch as doe him wrong,</hi> hee hath juſt cauſe to write and ſpeake as evill of them as he can. <hi>This later is his owne doctrine, not Chriſts.</hi>

               <hi>ſetled, fixt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſemper idem.</hi> We muſt neceſſarily conclude (and all rationall men with us) That the Reaſon of his <hi>Return</hi> was for the proſecution and execution of his malicious and bloody intent: And becauſe it is poſſible he is as well skil'd in Logick as Law, we ſhall frame an Argument, Thus.</p>

            <p>Ergo, <hi>Mr.</hi> Lilburns <hi>coming over into</hi> England, <hi>was to deſtroy the Lord Gen:</hi> Cromwel.</p>

            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Power,</hi> we ſay is in the people, (yet ſo as not in all, but with them who by their delinquency have not forfeited the ſame) The Government or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this power is in the perſons intruſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,

            <p>So that to ſuppoſe <note n="i" place="margin">As the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers mock'd Chriſt, when they put a reed in his hand, and a Crown on his head: And what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth he, then befoole the people, as to put on their heads the Crown of Liberty, and into their hand all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And afterward to tell them they cannot contradict or alter former lawes, but muſt continue ſlaves and vaſſals to their dying day.</note>

It is true we find him often ſcoffing and jeering at the things of God, but for the preſent <note n="i" place="margin">Here wee cannot ſay of this man, as it was ſaid of the Aſſe, <hi>the maſter hath need of him.</hi> For neither Chriſt nor his people have any need of him, as to the cauſe &amp; work of God going on in the world.</note>

            <p>When one aſked Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> whether he had ſeen the blazing Star, or no: he anſwered, that his work was ſo much below, on earth, as he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leiſure nor time to look up, to ſee what was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Heavens.

            <p n="3">3. Take him without his Wiles, and at the beſt: what are the things which he talks ſo much of? But in reſpect of our condition, ſo unneceſſarily, as the removall of them generally by honeſt men is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and deſired.
